Q&A Section
------------------------------------------------------------
Q1: The game crashes when loading/exiting a level when I play the mod.
A1: This seems to happen a lot more with Sonic+Elise mod, I really have no idea how exactly to solve this yet, for now just keep trying and it will work eventually, once you are able to play a stage and exit to HUB world at least once, it shouldn't crash anymore for the same play session.

Q2: I can only play regular Sonic mod, how do I play mods like Sonic & Elise?
A2: You need to use HedgeModManager and right-click to configure mod, it's recommanded to deprecate SonicGMI.

Q3: Why is 06 Result Music not working?/I want to disable 06 Result music!
A3: See above.

Q4: I'm playing with Japanese voice but I can still hear English voice (or vice versa)?
A4: To use voice mod properly you must also goto Option in game and change the appropriate voice over language.

Q5: Sonic isn't using the board in Crisis City when I play demo 3 Crisis City?
A5: Yes, because the demo 3 archive is outdated, but this will appear in the final release!

Q6: I can't get over the pit at the beginning of Generations Crisis City with 06 physics, help!
A6: Be patient, hold forward and let Sonic drop, the gravity defying homing attack will be able to home in to the last bird. You can enable lock-on cursor and see when it will actually lock-on.

Q7: I can't complete Sky Sanctuary Act 2/Adabat Act 1 with 06 physics!
A7: Unfortunately, because of the speed, you can't run pass the falling/crushing platforms, use FreeCam mod to skip past it.

Q8: The 06 HUD is not working.
A8: Put this mod higher priority than other mods, this is required for mods like STH2006 Project.
