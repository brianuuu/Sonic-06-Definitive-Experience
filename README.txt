Known Issues
------------------------------------------------------------
-The game sometimes can crash upon loading or exiting a stage, this happens rarely with Sonic but more fequently with Sonic+Elise mod, currently no solution has been found for this bug yet, for now just keep restart the game and it will work eventually, once you are able to play a stage and exit to HUB world at least once, it should not crash anymore for the same play session
-When 06 Button Mapping is enabled, navigation hint may not show the correct button

------------------------------------------------------------
Q&A Section
------------------------------------------------------------
Q: I can only play regular Sonic mod, how do I play other characters like Sonic & Elise?
A: You need to use HedgeModManager and right-click to configure mod, please deprecate SonicGMI.

Q: Why is 06 Result Music not working?/I want to disable 06 Result music!
A: See above.

Q: I'm playing with Japanese voice but I can still hear English voice (or vice versa)?
A: To use voice mod properly you must also goto Option in-game and change the appropriate voice-over language.

Q: Sonic isn't using the board in Crisis City when I play demo 3 Crisis City?
A: Yes, because the demo 3 archive is outdated, but this will appear in the later releases!

Q: I can't get over the pit at the beginning of Generations Crisis City with 06 physics, help!
A: After physics rebalancing in v3.0, this pit is now impossible for some characters' 06 physics, please use FreeCam mod to skip past it.

Q: I can't complete Sky Sanctuary Act 2/Adabat Act 1 with 06 physics!
A: Unfortunately, because of the speed, you can't run pass the falling/crushing platforms, use FreeCam mod to skip past it. Alternatively, transform to Super form where you will have much more speed.
