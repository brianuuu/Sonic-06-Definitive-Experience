Q&A Section
------------------------------------------------------------
Q: I can only play with 06 Sonic, how do I play other characters like Sonic & Elise?
A: You need to use HedgeModManager and right-click/double-click to configure mod, please do not use SonicGMI.

Q: How to I play with English/Japanese voice?
A: To use voice mod properly you must also goto Option in-game and change the appropriate voice-over language.

Q: Sonic isn't using the board in Crisis City when I play demo 3 Crisis City?
A: Yes, because the demo 3 is outdated, but this will appear in the later releases!

Q: I can't complete Sky Sanctuary Act 2/Adabat Act 1 with 06 physics!
A: Unfortunately, because of the speed, you can't run pass the falling/crushing platforms, use FreeCam mod to skip past it. Alternatively, transform to Super form where you will have much more speed.
